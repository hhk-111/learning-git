Set up local git repository:  git in it 
Git always keeps tracking of 3 trees: head, index and file system 
A tree --> a group of files 
Start with file system (making chains, add file ...) : git add . (Add all the changes in this directory, will update index ) 
Git commit 

to checkout a branch, from the current branch we are in, type

git checkout -b "new-branch-name"

so if we are on `main` and we type `git checkout -b "feature"`
we will now be in a branch `feature` that is an identical copy of `main`
